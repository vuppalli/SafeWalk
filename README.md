# SafeWalk

SafeWalk is a student-built app that aims to provide safety for college students walking home late at night. 
SafeWalk allows users to find another person to walk home with at night when their only other option is to walk home alone. 
When the user enters the app, the app finds their location and allows them to drop a pin on the place they are headed. 
Their name, current location, and destination are sent to a Google Cloud server which returns another user who had searched for a walking 
buddy, and sends both users the otherâ€™s information. It allows the user to cancel the request and look for another user and would also 
ideally implement a messaging system between the matched users and a 911 button using the SafeTrek API, which the user could keep open 
in the app until they have gotten home.
